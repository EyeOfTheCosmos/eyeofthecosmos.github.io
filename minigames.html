            <h1>Here are some Minigames I have made that you can play in your browser.</h1>
            <a href="https://eyeofthecosmos.github.io/tag/"class="link">Tag</a>
            <p>Tag is exactly what you expect. You do need a friend though, so most of you won't be able to play this game.</p>
            <a href="https://eyeofthecosmos.github.io/bomb-dodge/"class="link">Bomb Dodge</a>
            <p>Again, Bomb Dodge is exactly what you expect. You don't need a friend, thankfully, so most of you can play this.</p>
            <a href="https://eyeofthecosmos.github.io/not-subway-surfers/"class="link">Not Subway Surfers</a>
            <p>Not Subway Surfers is <em>NOT SUBWAY SURFERS</em>. It's completely different. Trust me.</p>
            <a href="https://eyeofthecosmos.github.io/geko-fly/"class="link">Geko Fly</a>
            <p>Geko Fly is probably the hardest game ever in existence. You control a little guy. A little goober, if you will, and you have to avoid SPIKES FLYING ACROSS THE SKY. Who cares about the balloon that's the only reason you're still alive? YOU don't want to get hurt! The balloon'll be fine.</p>
            <a href="https://eyeofthecosmos.github.io/apple-game/"class="link">Apple Game</a>
            <p>I don't know, it's kinda just an Apple Game. Eat Apple, get highscore, ignore large amounts of bugs.</p>
            <strong><p style="color: white; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Coming Soon: Some kind of Clicker, some kind of Space Invaders, some kind of Tower Defense.</p></strong>
